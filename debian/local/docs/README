LXC for Debian
--------------


1. Kernel

LXC needs various cgroup related features enabled in the Linux kernel.

If you use a non-Debian kernel, you can check your kernel configuration with the
lxc-checkconfig tool.

If you use a Debian squeeze kernel, all of the features are enabled except the
resource controller. This means that you can use LXC but cannot limit the amount
of RAM used per container. Every container can use as much RAM as the host
system offers. See http://bugs.debian.org/534964 for more information.

If you use a Debian wheezy kernel or newer, all of the features are enabled
including the resource controller.

In order to enable the memory controller for Debian wheezy, the following
boot parameter needs to be used:

	cgroup_enable=memory

In order to enable the swap controller for Debian wheezy, the following
boot parameter needs to be used:

	swapaccount=1

In order to enable apparmor which lxc can make use of, the following
boot parameter needs to be used:

	security=apparmor

Note: Kernel versions before 2.6.36 crash when using two bridge network
interfaces with LXC. If you need more than one bridge on the host system,
make sure you upgrade your kernel first.


2. Cgroup

LXC requires that the cgroup pseudo-filesystem is mounted. This can manually be
done with the following command, executed as root on the host system:

  # mount cgroup -t cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup

The corresponding entry for /etc/fstab looks like this:

  cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup cgroup defaults 0 0

This will eventually be done automatically as part of the mountkernfs initscript
in sysvinit. See http://bugs.debian.org/601757 for more information.


3. Autostart

LXC container can be automatically started on boot. In order to enable this, the
container that should be automatically started needs its configuration file
symlinked (or copied) into the /etc/lxc/auto directory.

Note that the name in /etc/lxc/auto needs to be the container name, e.g.:

  /etc/lxc/auto/www.example.org -> /srv/lxc/containers/www.example.org/config


4. Directory

LXC container are stored in /srv/lxc/containers by default. Various components within the
lxc package assume that the containers are there. Therefore, if you want to move
the containers to another directory, use:

  # dpkg-reconfigure -plow lxc

and answer the debconf question about the lxc directory accordingly. The package's
maintainer scripts will take care about updating the /etc/lxc/lxc.conf file.


5. Hierarchy of Preseed Files

The lxc-debconfig template script can be fully preseeded. Such preseed files
can include one or more preseed files themselfs (currently, only one layer of
includes is supported, no nested or recursive includes).

The general rule of 'the later preseed file overwrites the earlier' applies.
lxc-debconfig reads the main preseed file (specified either on command line or
by debconf selection/input dialog) after any included preseed files in there.

That means that debconf values *after* the include statement in the main preseed
file can overwrite any values specified in the included preseed files.


6. Bugs

  * veth not removed on container stop

    When stopping a container, it irregularly but reproducibly happen that the
    corresponding veth device of the container is not shutdown, making it
    impossible to start the container again.

    This is caused by a kernel bug not cleaning up veth devices on container
    collapsing. The veth device is supposed to be go away automatically after
    some time, definitely after a reboot though.

    A manual workaround is to shutdown the veth device manually with:

      # ip link delete ${VETH_DEVICE}

    There is a patch for it and hopefully landing in linux 3.7, see
    http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/containers/2012-October/030533.html
    for more information.
