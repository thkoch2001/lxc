.SH NAME
lxc-create \- creates a container
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBlxc-create\fR \fB-n \fIname\fB\fR [ \fB-f \fIconfig_file\fB\fR ] [ \fB-t \fItemplate\fB\fR ] [ \fB-B \fIbackingstore\fB\fR ] [ \fB-- \fItemplate-options\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBlxc-create\fR creates a system object where is
stored the configuration informations and where can be stored
user information. The identifier \fIname\fR
is used to specify the container to be used with the different
lxc commands.
.PP
The object is a directory created in \fI/var/lib/lxc\fR
and identified by its name.
.PP
The object is the definition of the different resources an
application can use or can see. The more the configuration file
contains informations, the more the container is isolated and
the more the application is jailed.
.PP
If the configuration file \fIconfig_file\fR
is not specified, the container will be created with the default
isolation: processes, sysv ipc and mount points.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB   -f \fIconfig_file\fB \fR
Specify the configuration file to configure the virtualization
and isolation functionalities for the container.
.TP
\fB   -t \fItemplate\fB \fR
\&'template' is the short name of an existing 'lxc-template'
script that is called by lxc-create,
eg. busybox, debian, fedora, ubuntu or sshd.
Refer to the examples in \fI/usr/share/lxc/templates\fR
for details of the expected script structure.
.TP
\fB   -B \fIbackingstore\fB \fR
\&'backingstore' is one of 'none', 'lvm', or 'btrfs'.  The
default is 'none', meaning that the container root filesystem
will be a directory under \fI/var/lib/lxc/container/rootfs\fR\&.
The option 'btrfs' need not be specified as it will be used
automatically if the \fI/var/lib/lxc\fR filesystem is found to
be btrfs.  If backingstore is 'lvm', then an lvm block device will be
used and the following further options are available:
\fI--lvname lvname1\fR will create an LV
named \fIlvname1\fR rather than the default, which
is the container name.  \fI--vgname vgname1\fR
will create the LV in volume group \fIvgname1\fR
rather than the default, \fIlxc\fR\&.
\fI--fstype FSTYPE\fR will create an FSTYPE
filesystem on the LV, rather than the default, which is ext4.
\fI--fssize SIZE\fR will create a LV (and
filesystem) of size SIZE rather than the default, which is 1G.
.TP
\fB   -- \fItemplate-options\fB \fR
This will pass \fItemplate-options\fR to the
template as arguments.  To see the list of options supported by
the template, you can run
\fBlxc-create -t TEMPLATE -h\fR\&.
.SH "DIAGNOSTIC"
.TP
\fBThe container already exists\fR
As the message mention it, you try to create a container
but there is a container with the same name. You can use
the \fBlxc-ls -l\fR command to list the
available containers on the system.
